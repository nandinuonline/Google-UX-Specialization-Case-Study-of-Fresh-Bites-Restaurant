Google-UX-Specialization-Case-Study-of-Fresh-Bites-Restaurant

The Fresh Bites Restaurant case study aimed to enhance the digital experience for patrons and potential customers. Through a systematic approach, I conducted user research, including surveys and interviews, to gain valuable insights into customer preferences, expectations, and pain points. This information served as the foundation for the project's UX design decisions.
Throughout the project, I also paid close attention to content strategy, incorporating enticing visuals and engaging copy to effectively convey Fresh Bite's unique brand identity and menu offerings. The project culminated in a compelling UX design proposal that could significantly boost the restaurant's online presence and customer engagement.
